# 🌍 Global Down Syndrome Mortality Analysis & Prediction (WHO Data)

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global mortality data related to Down Syndrome using WHO data. The aim was to understand patterns across countries, regions, age groups, and gender, and predict mortality rates using machine learning.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Country-wise, Age-wise, and Sex-wise Visualization
- Choropleth Map of global deaths
- Trend Analysis (Year-wise)
- Statistical Measures (Skewness, Kurtosis)
- Random Forest Regression Model
- Feature Importance Analysis
- Final Model Evaluation with MSE and R²

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📊 ML Results
- **Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **MSE**: 0.99
- **R² Score**: 0.77

## ✨ Insights
- Highest deaths concentrated in specific regions
- Significant variation in mortality by age and sex
- Age group and year are strong predictors
- Gradual change in trends observed over the years

## 📘 Conclusion
This end-to-end project highlights how data science can be applied to global health problems. Insights from this work may support health policy-making and awareness planning.
